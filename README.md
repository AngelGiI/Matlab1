**Numerical Methods in MATLAB**

This repository contains a collection of exercises and solutions developed during my studies in numerical methods, focusing on algorithm implementation and problem-solving using MATLAB. The exercises cover various topics, including:

- *Numerical Integration:*
Implemented midpoint, trapezoidal, and Simpson's rule to approximate definite integrals with specified precision.
- *Matrix Operations:*
Explored determinant properties, matrix norms, and custom implementations for matrix-vector operations.
*Linear Systems:*
- Solved linear systems using LU decomposition, forward/backward substitution, and iterative methods like Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and relaxation techniques.
*Root-Finding and Interpolation:*
- Developed bisection, fixed-point, and Newton's methods for root finding and constructed Lagrange and Newton interpolation polynomials.
*Error Analysis:*
- Investigated numerical precision loss and its impact on computations, as well as visualization of interpolation boundary effects.

These implementations are designed to reinforce core concepts in numerical methods and serve as a reference for applied problem-solving in scientific computing.
